            'I am super happy with my Gold Eclipse raising and lowering table from OMNI. The table has a perfect, compact size and is easy to operate. Compared to most other raising and lowering tables on the market, the eclipse is very light, relatively quiet and does not require connection to a power supply. Combined with the fact that the table can be folded when not in use, it is particularly suitable for the home office. Since my need for a raising and lowering table is temporary, it is far more flexible and economically advantageous to rent the table from OMNI than to buy.',

            'OMNI has a unique property for mixing office with the feeling of being at home. This means that you really just want to stay in the office when the clock strikes. All the guests we have visited cannot help but comment that it feels very homey and professional at the same time. I can therefore clearly recommend designing an office by OMNI.',

They took care of everything (I wasn‚Äôt even on-site myself). I have used them several times, and they are now my go-to furniture partner. Highly recommendable.',

            'OMNI gave us a fantastic home for our company with hand-built Danish designer furniture. There was butler service throughout, and the furniture was delivered into the office, fitted and made ready for use. Everything was done with enormous competence and wonderful energy. The materials are delicious, the quality is high, and the design is inviting and plays in Danish design heritage. I recommend everyone to get an OMNI office and the experience that comes with it!',
